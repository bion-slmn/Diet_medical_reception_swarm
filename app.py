This assistant is powered by a Swarm of three specialized AI agents:

- **Receptionist**: Handles general questions and redirects you to the right specialist.
- **Diet Specialist**: Offers advice on food, nutrition, and dietary preferences ‚Äî even in the context of medical conditions.
- **Medical Officer**: Helps analyze symptoms, conditions, or health concerns and suggests appropriate action or guidance.

The system intelligently routes your questions to the most relevant agent and can pass questions across agents when needed.
